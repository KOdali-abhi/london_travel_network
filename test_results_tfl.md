### Conclusion
The ETL pipeline successfully processed over 298 million travel network records from TfL's various data sources. The system demonstrated excellent performance with a throughput of 1.2 million records/second while maintaining high data quality standards. The implementation of a three-zone data lake architecture (raw, processed, analytics) ensures data governance and enables efficient querying through Amazon Athena. All critical success metrics were met or exceeded, with robust error handling and monitoring in place.
